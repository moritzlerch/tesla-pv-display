## 💡 Short description
This project uses an ESP8266 with attached LCD-Display to connect to the local API of the Tesla Powerwall (V2). It is displaying all the current power flows (grid, home, solar, battery) and the SOC (state of charge).

## 🎈 Showcase
**<p align="center">A picture says more than a thousand words!</p>**
<div align="center"><img src="./assets/pictures/showcase01.jpg" width=75% ></div>
<p align="center">(This is the main screen.)</p>


## ⚙ Features
- [Main screen](#-showcase) includes:
    - SOC (state of charge)
    - Four different power flows (grid, home, solar, battery)
- Power flows are formatted in an organized manner. No overlapping will happen, units of values are converted to properly fit and look nice. :-)
- Indicator (dot in upper right corner) for the current API request status

For more information on all the different screens have a look at [this wiki-page](https://github.com/MoritzLerch/pv_display/wiki/Different-screens).

## 👾 Installation and Usage
